                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a wok (or large deep pot) on low heat until heated. Add the oil, Korean chili flakes, minced garlic, minced ginger and the green onion and stir constantly for a minute or two. Take care not to burn the chili paste as this can give a bitter taste.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat up to medium and add the zucchini, mushrooms, cabbage, and onion. Cook them until lightly wilted (for 1 to 2 mins). Add the mussels, littleneck clams, prawns and squid (or baby octopus) and stir a bit.</li>
                <li>Add the rice wine, soy sauce and Korean soup stock (or water). Turn the heat up to medium high. Boil the soup covered until all ingredients are cooked through (about 8 mins) while avoiding overcooking. Remove the cover and add the salt and a few sprinkles of ground black pepper. Add the baby spinach just before serving. (If using baby bok choy, you may need to cook a little longer.)</li>
                <li>While the soup is boiling (in step 3), cook the noodles in boiling water following the manufacturer’s instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles briefly in cold water. (Step 3 and 4 should be completed around the same time.)</li>
                <li>Divide the noodles, seafood, and the soup between three soup bowls. Serve immediately. (If you prefer, you can also serve the soup with steamed rice instead of the noodles.)</li>
            </ol>
